- **In Progress Complaints**: Shows the number of active complaints being processed, giving insights into the current workload.
- **Disputed Rate**: Highlights the percentage of complaints that are disputed by consumers, useful for identifying patterns and potential issues in customer satisfaction.
- **Resolved at No Cost**: Indicates the percentage of complaints resolved without financial compensation, demonstrating the companyâ€™s ability to resolve issues satisfactorily.

## Visualizations
- **Total Complaints by Issue**: Bar chart showing the distribution of complaints across different issues, helping to prioritize improvement efforts.
- **Total Complaints by State**: A map visualization indicating the geographic distribution of complaints, useful for regional analysis and strategy planning.
- **Monthly Trend**: Line chart presenting the trend of total complaints received each month, to analyze seasonal or periodic variations.
- **Total Complaints by Product**: Breakdown of complaints by financial products or services, identifying high-risk areas.
